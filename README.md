# Rosalina Theme Installer

The themes on Wii U use two files, put them in the following paths:

Men.pack in 'wiiu/rosalina/install/Men.pack'
Men2.pack in 'wiiu/rosalina/install/Men2.pack'

There is a separate installer for each file, you can combine themes.

It's time to give your console a new style!!!
